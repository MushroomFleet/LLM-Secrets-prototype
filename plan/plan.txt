we can create a proof of concept agent persona with a special ability.
We will enable an LLM to write thoughts that it considers private or secret to an encrypted file.
The encryption key will be exposed as plain text in another file so that that file can be decrypted.
we should use a simple python based system, to test this proof of concept.
The Agent will behahaviour should not be altered beyond granting this facility to encrypt scecrets and private thoughts to individual encrypted files
these files should be written to "/private/" folder.
We can use a venv to install our package dependencies
we can create a plan for our system
we can consider the option of building this as an MCP in typescript
